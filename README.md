## How to Play

### Setup

- Nonsense requires 4 or more players and 1 phone.
- Form 2 teams.
- The game consists of 7 rounds each worth 1 point, the first team to 7 points wins.

### Gameplay

- At the beginning of each round pick 1 clue giver from each team.
- Next, the clue givers must agree on a shared secret Word (tap the "New word" button to get a Word).
- Now, each team takes 45 second turns, back and forth:
    - The current team's clue giver draws a new Rule (tap the "New rule" button) and announces the Rule to everyone.
    - Then, they give clues about the Word to everyone and MUST obey the Rule.
    - ONLY the CURRENT team can try to guess the Word. There is no limit on guesses.
    - Clue givers CANNOT tell their team the Word directly, but can confirm or deny a guess.
    - If the current team cannot guess the Word in time, it becomes the other team's turn.
- The first team to guess the Word wins 1 point and ends the round.

### Notes

- The losing team should be allowed to start new rounds.
- Clue givers may skip 1 Rule per round.
- If a Rule is ever broken or the Word is spoken directly, the team at fault must forfeit 1 point to the other team.
- Guesses that are proposed outside of a turn's time limit do not count.
- If both teams are stumped by a Word, upon a majority vote the game can enter Blitz Mode, where:
    - Both clue givers can say anything at any time, except the Word itself.
    - Both teams may guess at any time.
    - The first team to guess the Word wins the point.
