## How to play?
- Nonsense requires 4 or more players and 1 phone. Make 2 teams and pick 1 clue giver from each team.
- Together, clue givers draw a single shared word (tap the "New word" button) unknown to their teams. Each round teams will compete to guess the word. Clue givers may NEVER explicitly communicate the word. Also, clue givers may skip words until they agree on one.
- Now, clue givers and their teams will take 45 second turns trying to figure out the word.
- At the start of each turn, the current clue giver draws a new clue-giving rule (tap the "New rule" button) and announces the rule. Clue givers may skip 1 rule per turn.
- This clue giver must give clues to their team obeying the rule and only this clue giver's team may try to guess the word. A team can make unlimited guesses within the 45 second turn. Also, all clues given should be perceivable to both teams.
- If a rule is ever broken or the word communicated explicitly, the team at fault must forfeit 1 point to the other team.
- After 45 seconds, the turn ends and it is the other clue giver and team's turn to give clues and guess the word. Remember, the other clue giver should begin their turn by drawing a new clue-giving rule.
- The first team to guess the word wins 1 point and ends the round.
- However, if neither team can guess the word after 3 clues are given by each clue giver, the game enters Blitz Mode: Both clue givers may communicate without restriction (though they still CANNOT communicate the word explicitly) and both teams may guess at any time without restriction. The first team to guess the word wins the point.
- After a round ends, each team must pick 1 new clue giver and the losing team gets to start the next round. The new clue givers must pick a new word to guess for the next round.
- The first team to 7 points wins.
